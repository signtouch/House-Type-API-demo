In this example we are tying to get all the House Types that the `signtouch-site` might be using. For this reason we need to get houseTypes from the `signtouch-site`, `signtouch-region` and `signtouch-parent`.

Please read the example and use your own credentials to see this in action. 
The `TARGET_DEVELOPMENT` variable should be a `signtouch-site`.
